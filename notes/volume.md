# Volumes
Volumes are separate objects that have their lifecycles decoupled from containers.\
This means you can create and manage volumes independently, and they donâ€™t get deleted when their container is deleted.

## Creating and managing Docker volumes
```bash
docker volume create <volume_name> # creates new volumes with the built-in local driver.
```
Mounting a volume during container creation and deployment. Volume is created here if it is not already existing.
```bash
docker run -it --name cv --mount source=vol2,target=/vol ubuntu
```
