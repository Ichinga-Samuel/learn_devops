## Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm is a clustering and orchestration tool for Docker. It allows you to create a cluster\
of Docker hosts and deploy services across them. Docker Swarm is built into the Docker Engine and is a native\
clustering tool. It is simple to use and can be used to deploy services across multiple hosts. A host can be\
a physical machine or a virtual machine as long as it is running the Docker Engine.
